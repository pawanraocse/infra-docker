# task.md â€“ Production-Ready Implementation Tasks

This file breaks the PRD into independent, detailed tasks for robust, scalable, and secure AWS-based Spring Boot microservice development. Each task is self-contained and includes all necessary details for implementation, edge cases, and clarifying questions.

---

## 1. Repository & Project Bootstrap
- Create the prescribed directory structure:
  - src/main/java, src/main/resources, src/test/java, infra/, helm/, terraform/, scripts/
- Add .gitignore with standard Java, Maven/Gradle, IDE, and OS exclusions.
- Create README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and tech stack.
- Create copilot-index.md with architecture, modules, entry points, flows, APIs, naming conventions, and test coverage.
- Initialize Maven/Gradle project:
  - Set Java 21 as source/target.
  - Add dependencies: Spring Boot Starter Web, JPA, Flyway, Security, Actuator, Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, Testcontainers, Mockito, JUnit 5, springdoc-openapi.
- Verify build with `mvn clean install` or `./gradlew build`.
- Make a semantic initial commit (e.g., `feat: initial project structure and build setup`).
- Document any build tool version requirements in README.
- Validate that all folders/files exist and are tracked.
- Run static analysis (e.g., Checkstyle, SpotBugs) and ensure no critical issues.
- DoD:
  - All folders/files present and tracked in VCS.
  - Build passes with no errors.
  - Static analysis/linting passes.
  - Initial documentation (README, copilot-index.md) is present.

## 2. API Contract & Swagger/OpenAPI Integration
- Add springdoc-openapi dependency to Maven/Gradle.
- Create OpenAPI v3 spec for all planned endpoints:
  - Define paths, HTTP methods, request/response schemas, status codes, error models.
  - Include examples for each endpoint.
- Annotate controllers and DTOs with @Operation, @ApiResponse, @Parameter, etc.
- Configure Swagger UI endpoint at `/swagger-ui.html` and OpenAPI spec at `/v3/api-docs`.
- Document how to access and use Swagger UI in README.
- Validate that all endpoints are documented and match implementation.
- Add automated test to verify OpenAPI spec is generated and accessible.
- Edge cases:
  - Ensure undocumented endpoints are flagged.
  - Validate DTOs against OpenAPI schemas.
  - Handle missing or incomplete error models.
- Defaults:
  - PATCH endpoints: not required unless business need arises.
  - File upload/download: not required unless specified.
  - GET endpoints: support pagination, filtering, sorting using query params.
- DoD:
  - All endpoints documented in OpenAPI v3.
  - Swagger UI and /v3/api-docs accessible.
  - Automated test verifies spec generation.
  - API contract matches implementation.

## 3. DTO Design & Validation
- Define DTO classes for each API operation:
  - Use Java 21 records or immutable classes.
  - Annotate fields with validation constraints (@NotNull, @Size, @Pattern, etc.).
  - Document each field with Javadoc and OpenAPI annotations.
- Implement mapping logic between DTOs and domain entities (use MapStruct or manual mapping).
- Ensure DTOs are not coupled to JPA entities; use separate packages for DTOs and entities.
- Add unit tests for DTO validation logic.
- Document DTO structure and validation rules in copilot-index.md.
- Edge cases:
  - Handle nested DTOs and complex validation (e.g., custom validators).
  - Test large payloads and boundary values.

- DoD:
  - All DTOs are immutable and validated.
  - Mapping logic is covered by unit tests.
  - DTOs documented in OpenAPI and copilot-index.md.

## 4. Domain Model & Database Migration
- Design Entry entity:
  - Fields: UUID PK, JSONB metadata, created/updated timestamps.
  - Use Java 21 features (e.g., records for value objects).
- Create Flyway migration scripts:
  - Create table with appropriate columns and types.
  - Add indexes for performance (e.g., on UUID, timestamps).
  - Enable uuid-ossp/gen_random_uuid extension for UUID generation.
- Implement EntryRepository using Spring Data JPA:
  - Use Specification pattern for dynamic queries.
  - Add custom query methods as needed.

  - Annotate with @Validated for request validation.
- Implement EntryService:
  - Encapsulate business logic, mark boundaries with @Transactional.
  - Wrap low-level exceptions into domain-specific exceptions.
- Implement EntryRepository:
